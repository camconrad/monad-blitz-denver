# Git commits

- **Commit locally** after completing a good chunk of work or every so often during a session.
- Use clear, concise commit messages (e.g. "Add Britti Sans font implementation", "Fix options chain layout").
- **Do not push** — the user will push to GitHub manually.
- Prefer smaller, logical commits over one big commit at the end.
